Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.
 This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually hidden from the users.
  Free, open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendents of BSD are widely utilized today,
  powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones
  Free software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages.
